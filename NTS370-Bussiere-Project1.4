# The purpose of this script to print the numbers 1 through 100. When a number is divisible by 3 it will print Fizz instead of the number. When it's divisible by 5 it will print Buzz instead of the number. When it's divisible by both 3 and 5 it will print FizzBuzz

# Last revision date (9/21/20)

# For loop that prints a sequence of numbers, 1 through 100

for num in `seq 1 100`;
do
# If statement that asks if the printed number's remainder is equal to zero after division, if so it will print fizz Buzz

	if (( $num % 3 == 0 && $num % 5 == 0 )); then

		 echo "$num Fizz Buzz"

# If the remainder of the number is equal to zero when divided by 5 then print Buzz
		 	
	elif (( $num % 5 == 0 )); then

		echo "$num Buzz"

# If the remainder of the number is equal to zero when divided by 3 then print Fizz
	elif (($num % 3 == 0)); then

		echo "$num Fizz"

# If the number cannot be divided by 3 or 5 this is the response
